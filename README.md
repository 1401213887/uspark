# USPARK
------------------------------

Description
------------------------------
A fork of the SPARK Particle Engine (based on SPARK2) integrated inside Urho3D as ThirdParty.


To Build
------------------------------
To build it, unzip/drop the repository into your Urho3D/ folder and build it the same way as you'd build the default Samples that come with Urho3D.
Don't forget to overwrite Source/CMake/Modules/UrhoCommon.cmake to enable Spark thirdparty compilation.
