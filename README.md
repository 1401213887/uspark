USPARK
=======

A Urho3D renderer for SPARK Particle Engine (based on a spark2 fork).

----------

>- Currently in dev and only tested on Linux.
>- Use QtCreator to build it.
>- Put Urho3D CoreData and Data into build folder to run samples.

Building
-----------

>- You need Urho3D compiled. 
>- In **config.pri**, set variable "URHO3D_BUILD_PATH" to Urho3D build folder


Some samples that use OpenGL instead of Urho3D need extra libraries :

> sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libglew-dev libsdl2-dev libftgl-dev
